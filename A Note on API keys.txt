A note on API keys
==================

Although the workspace is the one I used to demonstrate the Leathere flet library functionality,
there are a number of API keys which need to be used to actually get things to work.

I have hidden mine in a file called Programs\config.json which is accessed by the program at
runtime out of which those API keys are read using the expression:

				(Config("tokens.keyName"))
				
			Example:
				
				(Config("tokens.locationIQKey"))

In order to make the sample function you will need to populate that with your own keys which you
should be able to get from each of the service providers.

There is a version of this file in the sample, but the keys in it are empty (mostly).

In many cases the actual keys are prefixed by the xxxx= setting to be passed as a URL parameter
in calls to the servicew involved, so you will see there: "locationIQKey"         : "key=", because
Location IQ wants key=yourAPIKey to be passed as a URL query paameter.

There are other settings in that file which should be self expanatory.
